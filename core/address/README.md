# Address

In Veda, there are two types of addresses: wallet addresses and contract addresses. These two addresses are represented in veda-core and ordinals content as btc wallet addresses (e.g., bc1...) and ordinals id (e.g., 4bcb...9fd4i0). Although both types of addresses are represented as 20 bytes hex strings in veda-bvm, their generation methods are different. You can learn about their specific generation methods in the [wallet address](wallet-address.md) and [contract address](contract-address.md) chapters.
